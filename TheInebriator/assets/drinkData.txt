Put the first six ingredients in a shaker glass without ice and shake until frothy. Fill glass with ice and pour Zima and the contents of the shaker glass at the time so it is a one-to-one ratio. Stir and serve. Makes about four drinks.(depending on the ice) Tastes like an Electric Lemonade with Zima instead of lemon-lime soda and more sour mix. Instead of triple sec, you can also use blue curacao. It makes it a pretty blue-green drink. Also, keep a LOT of extra ice on hand because this drink has so much alcohol it melts the ice immediately, which is why you should not put ice in the shaker, it will dilute the drink.

Begin by pouring in six cans of Bush Light, mixing in 1/4 of the total Everclear as you pour. Next add one can Red Bull and one can of lemon concentrate.

Finished batch should taste mostly of Red Bull, but be advised that it is fairly powerful, hence the name. Serve in the standard sized party cup, but be prepared to make several batches because one batch is only enough to feed the smallest of parties. Large amounts of Aristocrat Vodka or other vodka can be substituted for Everclear if you want to be a cheapass about it; but in order to maintain the kick you have to use at least twice the ammount.
